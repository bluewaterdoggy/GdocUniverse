# Gravity Sim

An interactive gravity physics simulation application built with React and TypeScript.

## Description

Gravity Sim is an educational tool that allows users to explore gravitational physics by simulating planetary orbits and gravitational forces. Users can adjust various parameters to see how they affect the gravitational force and orbital dynamics.

## Features

- Interactive sliders to control object mass, planet mass, distance, and velocity
- Real-time visualization of gravitational forces
- Adjustable visual parameters including star count and planet temperature
- Material selection (Rocky, Liquid, Gas)
- Educational tool for learning physics

## Live Demo

## Technical Stack

- React 19.2.0
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for development

## How to Use

1. Adjust the sliders to change object mass, planet mass, distance, and velocity
2. Watch the gravitational force calculation update in real-time
3. Select different materials to see how density affects the simulation
4. Use the star count slider to adjust the background

## Installation & Development

This application was created with Google AI Studio. To run locally:
