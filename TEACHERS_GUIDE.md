# Teacher's Guide - GdocUniverse Science Simulations

## Quick Start

Your science education website is now ready! All simulations are interactive and run directly in the web browser - no downloads or installations required.

## Accessing Your Website

Once you enable GitHub Pages (see README.md for instructions), your website will be available at:
`https://bluewaterdoggy.github.io/GdocUniverse/`

Share this link with your students!

## Available Simulations

**Best For:** Grades 9-12
**Activities:**
- Explore the relationship between frequency and wavelength
- Observe how amplitude affects wave appearance
- Calculate wave speed using v = f × λ
- Compare different wave types

### 5. Ohm's Law Calculator (Physics)
**Concepts:** Electricity, voltage, current, resistance
**Best For:** Grades 9-12
**Activities:**
- Calculate unknown values using V = I × R
- Explore series and parallel circuits
- Predict current flow in different scenarios
- Design circuits with specific requirements

### 6. States of Matter (Chemistry)
**Concepts:** Solid, liquid, gas, temperature, particle motion
**Best For:** Grades 5-10
**Activities:**
- Observe particle behavior at different temperatures

- Discuss kinetic molecular theory
- Compare particle speeds in different states

## Classroom Tips

### For Remote Learning
- Share the website link in your LMS (Canvas, Google Classroom, etc.)
- Assign specific simulations as homework
- Use simulations during video calls for demonstrations

### For In-Person Classes
- Display simulations on a projector or smartboard
- Have students work in pairs on computers/tablets
- Use as lab station activities
- Incorporate into lesson plans

### For Flipped Classroom
- Assign simulations as pre-class activities
- Have students answer questions about their observations
- Discuss findings during class time
- Build on simulation concepts with deeper material

## Assessment Ideas

1. **Lab Reports:** Have students write reports on their observations
2. **Data Collection:** Students record values from simulations
3. **Predictions:** Students predict outcomes before testing
4. **Comparisons:** Compare simulation results with real experiments
5. **Presentations:** Students present findings to the class
